=============
some things goes here.


rdrand-tmpfs-writer.py :

this script, specifically, will write 256000000 characters to stdout.
use: 
     ../rdrand-tmpfs-writer.py > /tmp/foo/rdrand.out 
or so.

And if you're using NIST software, it's 1000000 bits per bitstream, 256 bitstreams. Assess that.
Further, I'll unpatiently add, only works on python2 if you use easy_install on gentoo.
